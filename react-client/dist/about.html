            <p>Currently enrolled at Oregon State University, I'm planning to earn my B.S. in Computer Science in 2019. 
		    I also graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Rhetoric and American Studies, cum laude.</p>
		  
		  <p>In between my degrees, I worked as a nonprofit fundraiser
		  and grant writer for Bay Area nonprofits that helped students in underserved schools and low-income families in need of food.</p>
		  While working for these organizations and volunteering as a literacy tutor, I became aware of the technology's potential in solving community issues like educational inequity.</p>
		  
		  <p>I always enjoyed tinkering with web development, so why not take the next step? You can see what I've been building recently under Projects.</p>

            <h3 class="featurette-heading">In my spare time, I like to explore, think, and <span class="text-muted">be involved in my community</span>.</h2>
            <p>While studying computer science, I spent all of 2018 traveling around the world, visiting ten countries. 
		    I enjoyed swimming in Iceland and Australia, hiking all over New Zealand and the UK, eating everything in Japan and Spain, and meeting friends, old and new.
		  (By the way, I took the photo on the front page of this website, while hiking near the England-Wales border.)</p>
	<p>At home, I co-faciliate a book club that rereads children's literature and am on the board of an LGBT square dancing club. 
		I'm also into orienteering, film, and volunteering -- I've been a literacy tutor and a college application counselor.</p>
